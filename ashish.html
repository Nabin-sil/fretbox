    <h2>Tell us a little bit about yourself (background) and your journey as an entrepreneur, please;</h2>
	<p>Ashish Gupta, comes from a middle class business family. I was first salaried person in our family. I worked with MNCs in India & Abroad in UK / Bahrain for 10+ years. I had my H1B to work in USA , on the week of my flight to USA, I chose entrepreneurship over working in USA. My college best friend Bishnu joined me in 2014.Our First 2 ideas failed after partial growth. FretBox is our 3rd step. Bishnu promised to be with me always, and that's my biggest source of energy.</p>
  
    <h2>Why did you choose entrepreneurship over a job?</h2>
	<p>Business is always in blood for baniya person. I started looking for various business possibilities from tradition to technical parallel to working full time. Working for self and the community is our passion . Entrepreneurship challenges your every day & night, loads you with responsibilities of growth , expectations, needs of not just you, your entire team. I love talking about business & opportunities for hours and that drives me.
	
	<h2>How do you find the industry/niche that you're in? </h2>
	<p>I lived in urban housing communities for 15 years and faced challenges as resident from  maintenance/ management. When I stayed in UK, I found such challenges are every where, this opened up an opportunity idea of FretBox to me, which is focused around customer / resident happiness to most.
	
	<h2>What gets you out of bed in the morning i.e. what’s your source of motivation?</h2>
	<p>Driving my technical & sales team to full of their efficiency is the first thought for me in the morning. Customer payment is my biggest source of motivation, that’s the only resulted proof of your hard work you do.
		A nice idea, which can ease the communication and process for my customers are things that keep me going.
	</p>
	
	<h2>What challenges/obstacles did you face in your journey so far?</h2>
	<p>Every business has risks. Our risks are associated with a right skillset that we look for expansion in future. Sales is life of any business, all the years I have seen my family to sell in shops not at the customer door. Our business required people to sell at their door. Getting such right persons who can make sales from front has always been a challenge for me.
	</p>
	
	<h2>What comes first for you - money or emotions?</h2>
	<p>I am an emotional person. Business needs to have emotions, not personal, obviously, but business ones like concern for quality deliverables, client satisfaction, targets & roadmaps, you planned & how you will achieve it, etc. Money is obviously the priority but I believe if your value creation process is right for others, money will automatically come as an outcome of it.
	</p>
	
	<h2>How do you handle the pressure and manage stress?</h2>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Take a nap, play some video game , play with my daughter, talk to the team about their families, think of what joy your right effort can get you in future. </li>
			<li> Imagine your self as boss of the unicorn, the pressure on you once you become unicorn, then you realize the current state of pressure or stress is very small.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	
	<h2>What is one strategy that you believe has helped you grow as a person/startup?</h2>
	<p>I worked at my father’s kirana shop since a 8 year  child Until my graduation. He was very passionate for his self esteem / buying land  & uniting our family of 20. This made all of us in family very strong in managing and adjustments. We believed in building the trust and support, and that’s what I always cultivated into my team as well. Does not matter how many person we are in the team, it should represent 1 name, 1 brand, 1 value to the outside world. As A leader I try to Know everyone business and personal need of my team, understand their aspirations, and try to set mutual goals.
	</p>
	<p>In my team Bishnu, Praveen Bhargava, Anmol Gupta, Harikrishan yogi shared my dream for years. In today's world if you can make someone work with you for even 1 day for no money, you must feel proud of you & successful. 
	</p>
	
	<h2>In your opinion what are the keys to success?</h2>
	<p>Success is always  a relative word, I never put my self into any race. For me if my customer is happy, my team & family is happy I am more than happy. 
	</p>
	
	<h2>What advice would you give to someone starting out as an aspiring entrepreneur?</h2>
	<p>My advise to who starting out
		<ol>
			<li>It should be passion not money as first thought.</li>
			<li>If your family is not into business, first make a small shopkeeper as your friend, understand the challenges of business ground.
			<li>If your idea changes with other’s influence, better drop if today.
			<li>Find at least 2 person who are equal passionate as you.
			<li>In initial days, no one trust in you ideas, so better make a prototype / model all alone then talk to others. In business people believe in what they see, not what they hear.</li>
		</ol>
